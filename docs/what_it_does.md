It does what OSDU API does.
- better
    - 10x less code
    - fewer bugs
    - more endpoint coverage
    - lower learning curve
    - better representation of the business problem
        - qualitatively better
It allows you to address problems that you cannot address with your existing
code.    


It's not industry standard.
And it comes from a person low on the totem pole.
But if you are willing to settle for something that is more accurate, with fewer
bugs, that is a more accurate representation of your business problem, then you
might like it.
It will run circles around your other code.
You need to change the way you think.
You have been conditioned to accept buggy, super-slow-to-change code as normal.
It is not.
Well it is.
But it solves your business problems poorly.
Assuming you have interesting, complex business problems.

If you can see the value in this I want to know you.
And maybe work with you.
