### Interfaces / handoffs / context switch / complexity

Cognitive load is not a joke.


### Functional programming in Python

Python has almost all functional programming features of Lisp, except macros.

To get a handle on functional programming in Python, decorators are a good
starting point.  The coder who has a solid understanding of decorators is well
on the way to having a good grounding in functional programming in Python.
There are several things to consider.

- basic decorator
- class-based decorator

The first thing with decorators is to understand the simplest possible version.
Then we can move on to class-based decorators.   One could gain a solid
understanding without ever using class-based decorators but they are good to
know about and understand.  One could make the argument that a class-based
decorator is sort of like object-oriented Perl or a dog walking on its hind
legs.  You can do it but it is ugly and does not work well.  So feel free to
skip class-based decorators at first but come back and figure them out later.

Parameterized decorators, on the other hand, are essential for a good
understanding.  Decorators (and particularly parameterized decorators) are
a special case of Python functional programming.  But once you really understand
parameterized decorators you will begin to understand where functional
programming can be used most effectively.

Python is a multi-paradigm language.  It's support for functional programming is
solid and baked in.  It's not going away.  Treating Python as a strictly OO
language is like sawing off one of the legs of your three-legged stool.
You miss out on a lot.

- DAO: data in object drag
- WIP: work in progress
- SDK: software development kit, aka client

# FAQ

- Why not use DAOs?

Because DAOs are

- tedious to write
- error prone
- not the original data
- undocumented


#### what is the problem?

Q. What is the problem with most Python code today?
A. It is written for the convenience of the original programmer.  The ultimate
   programmer/user is not considered.

Q. So what?
A. If it's throwaway code, then NP.  But if the code continues getting used,
   problems accumulate.

Q. How to fix?
A. Start at the end and work backwards.  From POV of end user/programmer.


#### The other way

When you do this, the programmer ends up speaking about objects that
are familiar to a person who understands the API.  People such as

- manager
- data analyst

Streamlines the problem solving process.

do it.

### Advice

Put the logic into data.  Pero como de costumbre hay mas a pensar.



I like this distinction from wikipedia [1] "Anything that is a process or
procedure is business logic, and anything that is neither a process nor
a procedure is a business rule." Meaning constraints and the model represent
business rules.

I find that there are very few things related to programming that don't
constitute an interface in some way,
