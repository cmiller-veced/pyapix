A tool for quickly creating high quality API clients (SDKs).  Initial target APIs are
those defined in Swagger/OpenAPI.

# How to use it

Show how.  Right here.
If you are familiar with the SwaggerDoc for an API or a Postman collection, the
client will look familiar.  Many of your intuitions from SwaggerDoc or Postman
will help you in working with the client.

### You

The project takes an approach similar to both of the above.  You get access to
